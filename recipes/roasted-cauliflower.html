        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>These cauliflower steaks look beautiful on their own, and even better alongside a bit of mashed potato or yams. This is a great vegetarian alternative for meatless Mondays!</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 head cauliflower, trimmed</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or more to taste</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste (Optional)</li>
                <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
                <li>Place the cauliflower onto a cutting board with the stem side facing upwards; cut vertically into 4 steaks approximately even in thickness. Arrange 'steaks' onto the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle olive oil over the steaks; season with garlic powder, salt, and black pepper.</li>
                <li>Roast in preheated oven for 20 minutes, turn with a spatula, and continue to roast until soft in the middle and darkening around the edges, about 15 minutes more.</li>
            </ol>
